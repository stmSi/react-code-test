# Code Test Project

## Summary
This is an assignment project from Interviewer, built with Redux Toolkit, 
demonstrates the consumption of the JSONPlaceholder API 
to fetch and display a list of posts, 
search for specific posts by title, 
and display detailed information for individual posts, 
including their associated comments and user email addresses.
